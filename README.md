## Future Improvements?

The same filter feature could be for other options like for example via Tagging 
Searching a user could also be an added improvement to the project.

## My Feedback?

I guess this project gives the company an insight of how well a person is familiar
with the front end development especially using React.js , It was indeed a great
experience but a thing that confused me was , should i choose a fix user  or allow
the choice to select any user . Nevertheless I selected my own github repository 
for same purpose
